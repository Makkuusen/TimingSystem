# Timing System

## PRE-RELEASE

This plugin is still in early development. Although the plugin works and is used by a few servers, there is a severe lack of documentation and instructions on how to use it. Before adding this plugin to your server it's good to understand that you will probably run into a few issues a long the way.

## DEPENDENCIES

1. World Edit
2. SQL Database. It needs a database connection. Configure it in the plugins config.yml.
3. [optional] HolographicDisplays
