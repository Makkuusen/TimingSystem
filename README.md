# Timing System


## What does it do?
TimingSystem is a plugin that aims to do a few things.
* Creation and timetrials of 3 various track types. [Boats, Elytra and Parkour]
* Displaying leaderboards. Currently both In-game holograms and a commandbased ones.
* Creating and managing events to host races. (Currently only supports Boats).

## Installation
This plugin has made it's first real release. If you want to use it, make sure to follow our installation guide on our [wiki](https://github.com/Makkuusen/TimingSystem/wiki/Installing-the-plugin) 

## Dependencies
1. A Minecraft server running [Paper](https://papermc.io) (using native spigot will not work)
2. World Edit (I do recommend the use of [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fastasyncworldedit.13932/))
3. MYSQL Database. It needs a database connection. Configure it in the plugins config.yml.
4. [optional] [DecentHolograms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decentholograms-1-8-1-20-1-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/) or [HolographicDisplays 3.0.0](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/holographic-displays/files/4056176/download)

## Add-ons
* [Unofficial] [TimingSystemRESTApi](https://github.com/JustBru00/TimingSystemRESTApi) - Adds a basic JSON REST API to the TimingSystem plugin.
